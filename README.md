# Password Encryption/Decryption Tool

This Python script provides a basic password encryption and decryption tool using Base64 encoding. The tool allows you to encode (encrypt) passwords for safe storage or transmission and decode (decrypt) them back to their original form.

## Features

- Password encryption using Base64 encoding
- Password decryption using Base64 decoding

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `password_tool.py` file.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Run the script by executing the following command:


4. Follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt passwords:

- For encryption: Enter the password you want to encrypt.
- For decryption: Enter the Base64-encoded password you want to decrypt.

5. The encrypted or decrypted password will be displayed as the output.

## Security Considerations

It's important to note that the encryption provided by this tool using Base64 encoding is not intended for high-security purposes. Base64 encoding is easily reversible, and the encoded passwords can be decoded back to their original form.

For stronger password encryption and security, it is recommended to use industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and follow best practices for secure password storage and transmission.
